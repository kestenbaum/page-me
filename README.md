# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Styled-Components**, **React Query**, and **CRACO** for custom configuration. The portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in web development.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Styled-Components**: For writing CSS in JavaScript with scoped styles using tagged template literals.
- **React Query**: For fetching, caching, and synchronizing remote data in React applications.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **CRACO**: Create React App Configuration Override. Used to customize the webpack configuration without ejecting.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio adapts to different screen sizes and works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Interactive UI**: Various components are styled using **Styled-Components** to provide a modern, responsive user interface.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: React Query is used to fetch data dynamically from an API (for example, a list of skills, projects, etc.).
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized performance to ensure smooth user experience.
